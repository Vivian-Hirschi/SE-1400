    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
    <p>My competition is notion, and all scheduling apps.I like how notion is organized with to do's but it doesnt give youo many things to help you plan like a calender, progress bars, and easy acess stuff.Other websites also give you lots of ads and i wouldnt have any and no premium feutures.</p>
